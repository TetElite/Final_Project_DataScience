# Pain Medication Effectiveness Predictor

**Team 3:** Choeng Rayu, Tep Somnang, Tet Elite, Sophal Taingchhay  
**Lecturer:** Kim Sokhey  
**Course:** Data Science - Final Project  
**Academic Year:** 2025-2026

## 📋 Problem Statement

Same pain medication works differently for different people. Doctors use trial-and-error which:
- Delays patient relief
- Wastes time and money
- Leaves patients uncertain about treatment effectiveness

**Current Limitation:** No simple tool to predict medication effectiveness based on patient profile.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

Build a machine learning model that predicts whether a specific pain medication will be **Effective**, **Partially Effective**, or **Not Effective** for a given patient.

**Target Accuracy:** 75% or higher

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source:** Kaggle - [UCI ML Drug Review Dataset (Drugs.com)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/kuc-hackathon-winter-2018)
- **Original Size:** 215,063 patient reviews
- **Filtered Size:** ~5,000+ pain medication reviews
- **Columns:** 
  - `drugName` - Name of the medication
  - `condition` - Medical condition being treated
  - `review` - Patient's written review
  - `rating` - Patient satisfaction rating (1-10 scale)
  - `date` - Review date
  - `usefulCount` - Number of users who found review useful

### Filtering Criteria

**Pain Conditions:** headache, migraine, back pain, arthritis, sciatica, fibromyalgia, toothache, neck pain, joint pain, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic pain, neuropathic pain, muscle pain

**Pain Medications:** ibuprofen, acetaminophen, naproxen, aspirin, diclofenac, tramadol, hydrocodone, oxycodone, tylenol, advil, aleve, motrin, celebrex, meloxicam, indomethacin

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Activate Virtual Environment
```bash
cd /Users/macbook/CADT/Term2Year3/Data/Final_Project
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies (if not already installed)
```bash
pip install -r project/requirements.txt
```

### 3. Launch the Streamlit Dashboard (Primary Interface)
```bash
streamlit run project/app/dashboard.py
```

The interactive dashboard will open in your browser, providing the easiest way to:
- Make live predictions
- Explore model performance
- Visualize data insights

### 4. Alternative: Use Jupyter Notebooks
```bash
cd project/notebooks
jupyter notebook
```

Execute the notebooks sequentially (01 → 06):
1. **01_data_collection.ipynb** - Download and filter dataset
2. **02_data_cleaning.ipynb** - Clean and prepare data
3. **03_eda.ipynb** - Exploratory data analysis
4. **04_feature_engineering.ipynb** - Create features for ML
5. **05_modeling.ipynb** - Train and evaluate model
6. **06_final_analysis.ipynb** - Generate insights and results

## 🌐 Streamlit Dashboard

This project includes an **interactive web dashboard** built with Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface to interact with the Pain Medication Effectiveness Predictor.

### Launch the Dashboard
```bash
streamlit run project/app/dashboard.py
```

### Key Features
- **Live Predictions** - Enter patient details and medication to get instant effectiveness predictions
- **Interactive Visualizations** - Explore data distributions, medication effectiveness, and condition analysis
- **Model Performance Metrics** - View accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports
- **Feature Importance** - Understand which factors most influence predictions
- **Patient Insights** - Analyze how different patient characteristics affect medication effectiveness

### Why Use the Dashboard?
The Streamlit dashboard is the **primary way to interact with the model**. It provides an intuitive interface without requiring code knowledge, making predictions accessible to healthcare professionals and researchers.

---

## 📐 Classification Thresholds

The model classifies medication effectiveness based on patient ratings:

| Effectiveness Level | Rating Range | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Effective** | 8-10 | High patient satisfaction |
| **Partially Effective** | 5-7 | Moderate patient satisfaction |
| **Not Effective** | 1-4 | Low patient satisfaction |

---

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes

### 1. Prediction Model
- Working classification model
- Target accuracy: **75% or higher**
- Confidence scores for each prediction

### 2. Patient Insights
- Which patient traits matter most (age, condition, drug type)
- How similar patients responded to medications
- What factors influenced predictions

### 3. Key Findings
- Which pain conditions respond best to medication
- Whether age affects effectiveness
- Which pain medications work best overall

### Example Prediction:
```
"Ibuprofen for headache → EFFECTIVE (87% confident)"
```
